# mmc — progress log

Newest first. Every session that changes the project appends here: what landed,
what was decided, what's next. The stable plan lives in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).

## 2026-07-10 — session 2: cleanup, dashboard, MS3 kickoff

**Context:** previous session crashed after committing the MS1+MS2 baseline
(`6bd7af9 baseline no hardware bringup`). Verified on restart: all workspace
tests pass, so MS1+MS2 stand.

**Environment changes:**
- Rust updated to **1.97.0** (was 1.84). The edition-2024 dependency workaround
  is no longer needed; `rust-version = "1.84"` stays as a floor.
- **NUCLEO-G0B1RE** connected (ST-Link VCP). Purpose: early protocol bring-up
  and the hardware-modularity proof on Cortex-M0+ (no FPU). Not a motor target.

**Landed:**
- **Test-results reorg + dashboard.** Root-level `step_*.csv` strays removed;
  results now live in `testresults/<group>/` as CSV + `.meta.json` provenance
  sidecars, kept in git (`.gitignore` still ignores ad-hoc CSVs elsewhere).
  - `mmc-host suite` — runs the canonical scenario set (locked / free / loaded
    rotor current steps) into `testresults/ms2-current-loop/` and rebuilds the
    dashboard.
  - `mmc-host report` — regenerates `testresults/index.html` from whatever CSVs
    are in the tree, so hardware captures later get charts for free. Metrics
    (rise time, overshoot, steady-state error) are recomputed from the traces.
  - Dashboard is a single self-contained HTML file: step-metric tiles, dq
    current/voltage charts, speed, PWM duties, crosshair tooltips, keyboard
    navigation, light/dark, per-run data tables. Open `testresults/index.html`
    in a browser.
- **Docs:** this file + `docs/PLAN.md` (verbose in-repo plan; previously only
  in `~/.claude/plans/`).

**Suite numbers at this baseline** (2 kHz-rad/s design bandwidth, 10 kHz loop):
- Locked rotor: rise 1.00 ms (ideal 1.10), overshoot 0.0 %, SSE ≈ 0 %.
- Free rotor: rise 1.00 ms; ends voltage-limited at ~2 364 rpm (24 V bus), so
  the 1 A reference is unreachable at the end — expected without field
  weakening; SSE tile reads 99 % *by design of the scenario*.
- Loaded rotor (0.04 N·m): rise 1.00 ms; settles voltage-limited near
  2 323 rpm, current droops to torque balance (~0.5 A), SSE tile ~52 % —
  likewise physics, not a controller defect.

**MS3 landed (same session):**
- **`mmc-proto` for real**: COBS-framed, CRC16-checked messages (`0x00`
  delimited, self-resynchronizing), `no_std`/no-alloc/panic-free encode +
  incremental `Deframer`. Commands: ping, get-info, set-telemetry
  (mask + divider), stream on/off, set-iq-ref; telemetry frames carry a
  wrapping-µs device timestamp, channel mask, and packed f32 values.
  Channel registry in `mmc_proto::channel` doubles as CSV column order.
- **Sim behind the protocol**: `mmc-host serve` runs the virtual motor + FOC
  loop in real time behind a TCP server speaking mmc-proto. `mmc-host capture`
  connects over TCP *or* serial through one `Link` code path, streams to CSV +
  meta sidecar, and can command a live current step mid-capture. The suite now
  includes an end-to-end TCP leg (in-process server, 0.5 A step, ~1006 frames
  at 1 kHz, 0 rejected) → `testresults/ms3-telemetry/tcp_step.csv`.
- **NUCLEO-G0B1RE bring-up (hardware modularity proof)**: new
  `crates/mmc-fw-g0b1` (outside the host workspace; embassy-stm32 0.6,
  thumbv6m-none-eabi). USART2/PA2-PA3 (ST-Link VCP) at **1 Mbaud** (divides
  16 MHz HSI and the ST-Link clock exactly). Two tasks: RX (deframe + handle
  commands) and TX (responses + telemetry ticker). No inverter attached, so it
  streams a synthetic first-order plant (τ = 20 ms) driven by the commanded
  `i_q` — mmc-core's `math` runs on the M0+ in the process. Flashed with
  probe-rs (ST-LINK V2-1 detected on COM5).
- **Hardware capture on the dashboard**: 11 channels at ~990 Hz effective,
  **1,980 frames / 0 rejected** in 2 s; measured rise time 42.55 ms ≈ 2.2·τ,
  exactly right for the synthetic plant →
  `testresults/ms3-telemetry/g0b1_step.csv`.
- CI: thumbv6m builds of the shared crates + the G0B1 firmware build.

**Findings & fixes along the way:**
- Host serial reads were byte-per-syscall — capped ~300 frames/s; fixed with a
  4 KiB read buffer in `Link::recv`.
- The G0 at its 16 MHz reset clock is CPU-bound encoding frames (soft-float
  trig + bitwise CRC ≈ 2.3 ms/frame). Fixed: 64 MHz via PLL and one `sin_cos`
  per tick (other phases via angle-addition identities) → ~1.35 kHz max frame
  rate. Table-driven CRC16 is a future option if more headroom is needed.
- embassy-executor 0.10 renamed `arch-cortex-m` → `platform-cortex-m`; task
  instantiation now returns `Result` (arena); G0 needs the shared DMA IRQs
  (`DMA1_CHANNEL1`, `DMA1_CHANNEL2_3`) bound explicitly.

**Deferred from MS3:** a true *live* plot view (watch estimated vs. true angle
during observer tuning — needed by MS4, revisit then). Captures + dashboard
cover the current need.

**Next up (MS4):** flux observer + PLL behind `AngleEstimator` in sim, I-f
startup and handoff, sensorless speed loop, observer-vs-truth regression
sweeps. The MS3 telemetry path is how observer tuning gets watched.

## 2026-07-10 — session 1: MS1 + MS2

- Decisions: Rust, sensorless-first FOC, NUCLEO-G474RE target, MS naming.
- MS1: cargo workspace (`mmc-core`, `mmc-hal`, `mmc-proto`, `mmc-sim`,
  `mmc-host`), no_std enforced via thumbv7em build, CI workflow, fmt/clippy.
- MS2: PMSM dq model + average-value inverter in `mmc-sim` (semi-implicit Euler,
  1 µs substeps), Clarke/Park, SVPWM, PI with anti-windup + feedforward
  decoupling, `Foc::step` current loop, `TruthAngle` estimator, `tuning.rs`
  bandwidth-based gain calc, step-response metrics + regression tests,
  `mmc-host sim --scenario current-step` CSV runs.
- Committed as `6bd7af9` "baseline no hardware bringup". Session crashed after.
