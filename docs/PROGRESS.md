# mmc — progress log

Newest first. Every session that changes the project appends here: what landed,
what was decided, what's next. The stable plan lives in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).

## 2026-07-10 — session 2: cleanup, dashboard, MS3 kickoff

**Context:** previous session crashed after committing the MS1+MS2 baseline
(`6bd7af9 baseline no hardware bringup`). Verified on restart: all workspace
tests pass, so MS1+MS2 stand.

**Environment changes:**
- Rust updated to **1.97.0** (was 1.84). The edition-2024 dependency workaround
  is no longer needed; `rust-version = "1.84"` stays as a floor.
- **NUCLEO-G0B1RE** connected (ST-Link VCP). Purpose: early protocol bring-up
  and the hardware-modularity proof on Cortex-M0+ (no FPU). Not a motor target.

**Landed:**
- **Test-results reorg + dashboard.** Root-level `step_*.csv` strays removed;
  results now live in `testresults/<group>/` as CSV + `.meta.json` provenance
  sidecars, kept in git (`.gitignore` still ignores ad-hoc CSVs elsewhere).
  - `mmc-host suite` — runs the canonical scenario set (locked / free / loaded
    rotor current steps) into `testresults/ms2-current-loop/` and rebuilds the
    dashboard.
  - `mmc-host report` — regenerates `testresults/index.html` from whatever CSVs
    are in the tree, so hardware captures later get charts for free. Metrics
    (rise time, overshoot, steady-state error) are recomputed from the traces.
  - Dashboard is a single self-contained HTML file: step-metric tiles, dq
    current/voltage charts, speed, PWM duties, crosshair tooltips, keyboard
    navigation, light/dark, per-run data tables. Open `testresults/index.html`
    in a browser.
- **Docs:** this file + `docs/PLAN.md` (verbose in-repo plan; previously only
  in `~/.claude/plans/`).

**Suite numbers at this baseline** (2 kHz-rad/s design bandwidth, 10 kHz loop):
- Locked rotor: rise 1.00 ms (ideal 1.10), overshoot 0.0 %, SSE ≈ 0 %.
- Free rotor: rise 1.00 ms; ends voltage-limited at ~2 364 rpm (24 V bus), so
  the 1 A reference is unreachable at the end — expected without field
  weakening; SSE tile reads 99 % *by design of the scenario*.
- Loaded rotor (0.04 N·m): rise 1.00 ms; settles voltage-limited near
  2 323 rpm, current droops to torque balance (~0.5 A), SSE tile ~52 % —
  likewise physics, not a controller defect.

**In flight (MS3):** mmc-proto framing (COBS + CRC frames, telemetry channels,
command set), sim TCP server, host capture, G0B1RE UART firmware speaking the
same protocol. See PLAN.md MS3 for the amended scope.

## 2026-07-10 — session 1: MS1 + MS2

- Decisions: Rust, sensorless-first FOC, NUCLEO-G474RE target, MS naming.
- MS1: cargo workspace (`mmc-core`, `mmc-hal`, `mmc-proto`, `mmc-sim`,
  `mmc-host`), no_std enforced via thumbv7em build, CI workflow, fmt/clippy.
- MS2: PMSM dq model + average-value inverter in `mmc-sim` (semi-implicit Euler,
  1 µs substeps), Clarke/Park, SVPWM, PI with anti-windup + feedforward
  decoupling, `Foc::step` current loop, `TruthAngle` estimator, `tuning.rs`
  bandwidth-based gain calc, step-response metrics + regression tests,
  `mmc-host sim --scenario current-step` CSV runs.
- Committed as `6bd7af9` "baseline no hardware bringup". Session crashed after.
